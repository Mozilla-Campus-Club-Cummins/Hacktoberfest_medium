## How to contribute (Hacktoberfest-friendly)

To make sure your contribution counts for Hacktoberfest and is helpful to maintainers:

* Make sure your PR contains meaningful changes (no trivial or auto-generated edits).
* Follow the content guidelines below.
* Add a short description in the PR explaining the article's scope and audience.
* If you're submitting multiple PRs, vary the topics and ensure each PR is standalone.

Helpful labels you can add to your PR (if you have permissions): `hacktoberfest`, `good first issue`, `documentation`.

## Content guidelines

When writing or editing an article, follow these simple rules:

* Use Markdown (`.md`).
* Keep articles between 500â€“1500 words for short-form content.
* Use headings, lists, and code blocks to improve readability.
* Include a short summary / TL;DR at the top.
* Add references and links for external resources.
* If you include images, place them in `assets/` and reference them with relative paths.
* Make sure code samples are copy-paste runnable when reasonable.

Suggested article template (see `templates/article-template.md`):
